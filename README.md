At the suggestion of Christian Thalmann, This font has moved it's base from Cormorant to EB Garamond.  I intend the final form to be main body text for general purpose typesetting in traditional style. Christian was clear that Cormorant is a display font, not a font for body text. 

This 2025 version is designed in FontForge. For this version I used a not-recommended import of the .ttf file. of EB Garamond, then copied Glyphs from Garamond-Math within FontForge. I have not addressed any substitution tables yet.  So, very likely this font is an exploration that may eventually result in new glyphs in EB Garamond, Garamond-Math, or Cormorant, or another restart with with a more direct and accurate translation of the EB Garamond font into a font I can customize for typesetting. 

## AVMagellan 2025
This release focuses on glyphs book designers may find useful, including:
- enclosed numbers to 50 (useful for footnotes),
- enclosed alphabets (useful for dropcaps),
- an expanded set of brackets,
- an expanded  set of quote like marks,
- double struck letters,
- an expanded set of geometric shapes,
- Aegean tally marks (some used for quote like marks, but the set used for bullets,)
- an expanded set of section breaking characters, 
- and an expanded set of arrows. 

There are incomplete and probably outdated glyph maps of most of these in the [wiki](https://github.com/Avante-Vangard/AV-Magellanicus/wiki/Version-2025.001-notes).[]
